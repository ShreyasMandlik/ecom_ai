# üõçÔ∏è AI-Powered Product Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements a multi-agent, AI-driven recommendation engine designed to deliver high-quality, personalized product suggestions based on customer behavior and preferences. Built using Python, Django, and LLMs like TinyLlama and LLaMA 3.2 (via Ollama), the system is modular, scalable, and cost-efficient.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Customer Behavior Analysis**  
  Leverages AI to analyze demographics, browsing patterns, and purchase history to identify customer preferences.

- **Product Filtering & Scoring**  
  Narrows down product catalog based on inferred categories and affinity scores like price match, seasonality, and sentiment.

- **Personalized Recommendation**  
  Uses deep context reasoning to recommend top products that match the customer's needs.

## üß† Agents' Interaction Design

- **CustomerAgent**  
  Analyzes customer data (demographics, behavior, history) and infers relevant product categories.

- **ProductAgent**  
  Filters the product catalog using AI-inferred categories and scores them based on multiple affinity metrics. Selects the top 100.

- **RecommendationAgent**  
  Chunks filtered products into batches, then selects the top 3 from each using deep customer context and AI reasoning.
